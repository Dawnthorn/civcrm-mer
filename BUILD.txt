How to regenerate SQL from schema
---------------------------------

1. You need to have a copy of the CiviCRM source code (not the Drupal
package).
2. Create a symlink to the civicrm_mer/schema/Event/Cart directory from the
xml/schema/Event directory in the CiviCRM source code. E.g. 
cd xml/schema/Event
ln -s <drupal_site_path>/sites/all/modules/civicrm_mer/schema/Event/Cart
3. Generate the SQL
cd ../..
php GenCode.php schema/Schema.xml
4. Open up sql/civicrm.mysql and pull out the tables that got created and put
them in sql/0.1.mysql.
5. Copy the generated DAO files into the plugin:
cp CRM/Event/DAO/EventInCart.php <drupal_site_path>/sites/all/modules/civicrm_mer/CRM/Event/DAO/
cp CRM/Event/DAO/Cart.php <drupal_site_path>/sites/all/modules/civicrm_mer/CRM/Event/DAO/
